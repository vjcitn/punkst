# Installation Guide for **punkst**

This guide covers prebuilt Linux tarballs and source builds on Linux and macOS, including systems where you do not have root access.

## Prebuilt Linux Tarballs

Prebuilt Linux tarballs are intended for linux users who want to run
`punkst` without compiling from source. They are attached to GitHub Releases: <https://github.com/Yichen-Si/punkst/releases>

(You would still need to clone the repository get example data and workflow templates)

### Choosing the Right Build

To get reasonable performance out of `punkst`, choose the tarball that best matches your system's Linux environment (glibc) and CPU capabilities.

*Note: the tarball includes a built-in `./bin/env-check` script. If you download a version your system doesn't support, the script should safely catch it and tell you which version to download instead*

1. Check your glibc version
```bash
ldd --version
```
* If your version is **2.28 or higher** (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04+, RHEL 8+): Download a `glibc2.28` tarball.
* If your version is **2.17 to 2.27** (e.g., CentOS 7, Ubuntu 18.04): Download a `glibc2.17` tarball.

2. Check your CPU (hardware capabilities)

```bash
grep -q avx512f /proc/cpuinfo && echo "x86_64-v4" || (grep -q avx2 /proc/cpuinfo && echo "x86_64-v3" || echo "x86_64")
```

* **`x86_64-v4`**: Modern enterprise CPUs (Intel Skylake-X/Xeon or newer, AMD Zen 4 or newer, with AVX-512 support)
* **`x86_64-v3`**: Most standard CPUs made after 2015 (Intel Haswell+, AMD Zen 1-3)
* **`x86_64`**: Older CPUs or lightweight VMs

The performance difference may be significant, mostly due to optimizations inside Eigen. It is important to choose the matching prebuilt tarball.

**Note**: on HPC, you may need to check the features of the compute node. For example, with slurm scheduler you can do `srun -p <PARTITION> bash -c 'ldd --version | head -n 1'` and `srun -p <PARTITION> bash -c 'echo -n "$(hostname): " && (grep -q avx512f /proc/cpuinfo && echo "x86_64-v4" || (grep -q avx2 /proc/cpuinfo && echo "x86_64-v3" || echo "x86_64"))'`

### After downloading

```bash
tar -xzf punkst-*-linux-x86_64*-glibc*.tar.gz
cd punkst-*-linux-x86_64*-glibc*
./bin/env-check
```

`bin/env-check` is a shell helper that checks the host glibc version and CPU features before launching `bin/punkst` with the bundled libraries. If checks pass, it shows the punkst help message, then the binary `./bin/punkst` is ready to use.

The tarball includes Markdown documentation under `docs/`. The latest documentation is available online at <https://yichen-si.github.io/punkst/>.

## Building from Source

### Requirements

Core build requirements:

- Git
- CMake >= 3.15
- C++17 compiler*
- TBB
- zlib
- BZip2
- LibLZMA

Optional feature requirements:

- libpng: needed only when `ENABLE_IMAGE_OUTPUT=ON`, which is the default
- libcurl: needed only when `ENABLE_REMOTE_IO=ON`, which is the default

*GCC 9 or newer is the supported Linux baseline. GCC 8 may work in some environments, but older `std::filesystem` support varies across distributions. Clang, Apple Clang, and MSVC need C++17 standard library support.

Image output commands write PNG files and require output paths ending in `.png`.

### Quick Build

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/your-org/punkst.git
cd punkst

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --parallel
```

For single-config generators such as Unix Makefiles and Ninja, `cmake ..` defaults to a `Release` build to prioritize runtime performance.

If the repository was cloned without submodules, initialize them before configuring:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

The `punkst` binary is placed in `bin/` under the project root.

Verify the build:

```bash
../bin/punkst --help
```

You should see a message starting with:

```text
Available Commands
The following commands are available:
```

### System Packages

Install dependencies with your system package manager when possible:

| Library | Ubuntu / Debian | CentOS / RHEL | macOS Homebrew |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TBB | `sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev` | `sudo yum install tbb-devel` | `brew install tbb` |
| zlib | `sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev` | `sudo yum install zlib-devel` | `brew install zlib` |
| BZip2 | `sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev` | `sudo yum install bzip2-devel` | `brew install bzip2` |
| LibLZMA | `sudo apt-get install liblzma-dev` | `sudo yum install xz-devel` | `brew install xz` |
| libpng | `sudo apt-get install libpng-dev` | `sudo yum install libpng-devel` | `brew install libpng` |
| libcurl | `sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev` | `sudo yum install libcurl-devel` | `brew install curl` |

### Minimal Build Without a Package Manager

This recipe builds `punkst` without installing TBB, libpng or libcurl. It was used on macOS (Apple Clang) without Homebrew, and is a reasonable starting point when you cannot or prefer not to install system packages. It needs only Git, CMake >= 3.15, a C++17 compiler, and the system zlib, BZip2 and LibLZMA libraries.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/punkst.git
cd punkst
git submodule update --init ext/eigen ext/faiss ext/clipper2

mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. \
  -DFETCH_TBB=ON \
  -DENABLE_IMAGE_OUTPUT=OFF \
  -DENABLE_REMOTE_IO=OFF \
  -DENABLE_NATIVE_ARCH=OFF
cmake --build . --parallel
../bin/punkst --help
```

What the options do:

- `FETCH_TBB=ON` downloads and builds oneTBB during the build (slower, but needs no installed TBB).
- `ENABLE_IMAGE_OUTPUT=OFF` removes the PNG output commands, so libpng is not needed.
- `ENABLE_REMOTE_IO=OFF` disables `http(s)` and `s3://` inputs, so libcurl is not needed. Local files work as usual.
- `ENABLE_NATIVE_ARCH=OFF` avoids `-march=native`, so the binary runs on other machines with the same architecture.

If `cmake` is not on your `PATH`, call it by its full path (for example the `CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake` bundled with a CMake macOS install). If OpenMP is not found, the configure step reports that Faiss is skipped; the pipelines used in the SpatialData workflow (`pts2tiles`, `tiles2hex`, `topic-model`) do not depend on it in our runs.

### Rootless Installs

If dependencies are installed under a user prefix, pass that prefix to CMake:

```bash
cmake .. \
  -DTBB_DIR="$HOME/.local/lib/cmake/tbb" \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/.local"
```

#### TBB
For TBB, see [oneTBB installation guide](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

Install from released packages:
```bash
wget https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/releases/download/v2023.0.0/oneapi-tbb-2023.0.0-lin.tgz
tar -zxvf oneapi-tbb-2023.0.0-lin.tgz
```
Then do the following (everytime) before you build punkst
```bash
source oneapi-tbb-2023.0.0/env/vars.sh
```

#### libpng
For libpng without root access, use a user-level package manager when available:

```bash
# conda/mamba
conda install -c conda-forge libpng zlib
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$CONDA_PREFIX"

# spack
spack install libpng
spack load libpng
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(spack location -i libpng)"
```

If package managers are unavailable, libpng can be built from source into a user prefix. Build zlib locally first as well if the system zlib development files are unavailable.

```bash
cmake -S /path/to/libpng -B /path/to/libpng/build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
cmake --build /path/to/libpng/build --parallel
cmake --install /path/to/libpng/build

cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/.local"
```

### Optional Features

- **png output**

Image output is enabled by default:

```bash
cmake .. -DENABLE_IMAGE_OUTPUT=ON
```

This builds:

- `draw-pixel-factors`
- `draw-lowres-factors`
- `draw-pixel-features`

Disable image output to build without libpng:

```bash
cmake .. -DENABLE_IMAGE_OUTPUT=OFF
```

- **Remote I/O**

Remote random-access readers for `http(s)` and `s3://` inputs are enabled by default:

```bash
cmake .. -DENABLE_REMOTE_IO=ON
```

Disable remote I/O to build without libcurl. Local-file input still works.

```bash
cmake .. -DENABLE_REMOTE_IO=OFF
```

- **Faiss ANN for k-NN**

Faiss ANN is only used in `punkst leiden`, which is just a convenient implementation of the Leiden algorithm for k-NN graphs constructed based on inferred factor compositions. ANN is advantageous only for very large datasets (e.g. close to `10^6` cells) and Faiss ANN has a lot more dependencies, so it is completely optional. Currently prebuilt binaries do NOT include Faiss ANN.

Faiss ANN support defaults to `AUTO`. CMake enables it when CMake 3.24 or newer,
the pinned `ext/faiss` source, C++20 compiler support, OpenMP, BLAS, and LAPACK
are all available. (Note: the main punkst sources remain C++17)

Override the default with `-DPUNKST_ENABLE_FAISS_ANN=ON` (missing dependence leads to error) or `-DPUNKST_ENABLE_FAISS_ANN=OFF`.

### Performance And Portability

The default build prioritizes local runtime performance:

- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` when no build type is specified
- `ENABLE_LTO=ON`
- `ENABLE_NATIVE_ARCH=ON`
- `PUNKST_ENABLE_FAISS_ANN=AUTO`

Useful CMake options:

| Goal | CMake command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Default local performance | `cmake ..` | Release build with `-march=native` when supported |
| Maximum CPU portability | `cmake .. -DENABLE_PORTABLE_BUILD=ON` | Disables architecture-specific tuning flags |
| Modern x86_64 baseline | `cmake .. -DENABLE_NATIVE_ARCH=OFF -DENABLE_X86_64_V3=ON` | Targets x86-64-v3 on compatible x86_64 systems |
| AVX-512 x86_64 target | `cmake .. -DENABLE_NATIVE_ARCH=OFF -DENABLE_X86_64_V4=ON` | Targets x86-64-v4 on compatible AVX-512 systems |
| Disable LTO | `cmake .. -DENABLE_LTO=OFF` | Useful for faster/debug builds or toolchains where LTO is unreliable |
| No image output | `cmake .. -DENABLE_IMAGE_OUTPUT=OFF` | Builds without libpng |
| No remote I/O | `cmake .. -DENABLE_REMOTE_IO=OFF` | Builds without libcurl |
| Require Faiss ANN k-NN | `cmake .. -DPUNKST_ENABLE_FAISS_ANN=ON` | Adds explicit HNSW and NN-descent backends, or stops configuration if their prerequisites are unavailable |
| Disable Faiss ANN k-NN | `cmake .. -DPUNKST_ENABLE_FAISS_ANN=OFF` | Builds without Faiss even when its prerequisites are available |

<!-- ## Maintainer Release Packaging

Release tarballs are built manually on controlled native Linux hosts, not with
Docker and not with GitHub Actions. Build on the oldest glibc version that the
release should support.

Example:

```bash
script/package_linux_release.sh \
  --version v0.1.0 \
  --tier x86_64-v3 \
  --glibc-min 2.28
```

Build all standard tiers:

```bash
for tier in x86_64 x86_64-v3 x86_64-v4; do
  script/package_linux_release.sh \
    --version v0.1.0 \
    --tier "$tier" \
    --glibc-min 2.28
done
```

The script writes tarballs, `SHA256SUMS`, and a JSON-lines manifest under
`dist/`. Attach those files directly to the GitHub Release for the matching tag.
Do not commit release tarballs to git. -->
