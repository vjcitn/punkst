# Notes on processing data from different technologies/platforms

Here are instructions on how to convert raw data from different platforms to the generic pixel/transcript level input format for punkst. This input format is a plain tsv file storing transcripts/pixels by spatial tiles, accompanied by an index file. The minimum information is x and y coordinates (in microns), transcript IDs (gene names), and counts. If you have auxiliary information or annotations that may be useful for downstream analysis, such as z-plane, cell IDs, subcellular compartment annotions, etc., keep them as additional columns.

For spot/single cell level data, `topic-model` now accepts 10X style DGE files directly, but you can also convert them to our custom format (see the last section below)

<!-- Except for Visium HD (see below), we provide a pair of template `Makefile` and `config_prepare.json` files in the `examples/format_input` directory for each platform. You can copy `config_prepare.json` to your directory and modify the parameters, then generate the concrete `Makefile` by
```bash
python /path/to/punkst/ext/py/generate_workflow.py \
  -t /path/to/punkst/examples/format_input/cosmx/Makefile \
  -c config_prepare.json -m Makefile
```
then run `make`. -->

After the conversion, you can follow the standard workflow as described in [the quick start page](../workflows/index.md) to run the pipeline (and specify all coordinate/size related parameters in microns). For platforms that provide cell coordinates, we also extracted the cell centers and you can try the experimental workflow in `examples/with_cell_centers`.

(We currently documented examples for 10X Genomics Visium HD, Xenium, NanoString CosMx SMI, and Vizgen MERSCOPE data. We've also applied punkst to Seq-scope, Stereo-seq, and other similar platforms, we are working on providing more information.)

## Visium HD

First we need to locate the "binned output" directory and the subdirectory with the original resolution. For the data downloaded from 10X website it is called `binned_outputs/square_002um`. Let's call it `RAWDIR`. In this directory, you should find the subdirecotries, `spatial` and `filtered_feature_bc_matrix` (I guess you could also use data in `raw_feature_bc_matrix` but I've not tried it yet).

In the `spatial` directory, you should have a json file that contains the scaling factor of the coordinates, named as `scalefactors_json.json`.
Let's grep the scaling factor (or set it manually).
```bash
microns_per_pixel=$(grep -w microns_per_pixel ${RAWDIR}/spatial/scalefactors_json.json | perl -lane '$_ =~ m/.*"microns_per_pixel": ([0-9.]+)/; print $1' )
#  "microns_per_pixel": 0.2737129726047599 in an example data
```

The spatial coordinates for each barcode are stored in `parguet` format, we do not support this format directly. Let's convert it to plain tsv file. [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/) seems fast and easy to use:

```bash
cd ${RAWDIR}/spatial/
duckdb -c "COPY (SELECT * FROM read_parquet('tissue_positions.parquet')) TO 'tissue_positions.tsv' (HEADER, DELIMITER '\t');"
```

Alternatively, you can try to use [pyarrow and pandas in python](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_parquet.html).


Next, punkst has a command to merge the 10X style dge files (and the spatial coordinates) into a single file as our standard input:

```bash
brc_raw=${RAWDIR}/spatial/tissue_positions.tsv # the one converted from parquet
mtx_path=${RAWDIR}/filtered_feature_bc_matrix # path to the 10X style dge files
punkst convert-dge \
--microns-per-pixel ${microns_per_pixel} \
--exclude-regex '^mt-' --in-tissue-only \
--in-positions ${brc_raw} \
--in-dge-dir ${mtx_path} \
--output-dir ${path} \
--coords-precision 4
```

Here the optional flag `--exclude-regex` takes a regular expression to exclude genes matching with the regex. In the above example we exclude all mitochondrial genes.

The optional flag `--in-tissue-only` will exclude all barcodes that are labeled as not in the tissue.

The command writes `transcripts.tsv` with coordinates in microns.

The first column of the output file is the row index (0-based) of the barcode in the input barcode file (`${mtx_path}/barcodes.tsv.gz`), in case we want to recover the original barcode ID later.

## CosMx SMI

<!-- You can use the template `Makefile` and `config_prepare.json` in `punkst/examples/format_input/cosmx` to conver CosMx raw output files to the generic input format. Alternatively, see the bash commands below.
Copy the config file to your directory and set the raw file names. For example, here is an example for the public mouse half brain data:

```json
{
    "workflow": {
      "raw_tx" : "Run1000_S1_Half_tx_file.csv",
      "raw_meta": "Run1000_S1_Half_metadata_file.csv",
      "microns_per_pixel": 0.12,
      "datadir": "/output/test"
    }
  }
``` -->

Find `"microns_per_pixel"` in the ReadMe.html, it may say something like "To convert to microns multiply the pixel value by 0.12 um per pixel".

Locate two files, `RunXXXX_tx_file.csv` (transcript file) and `RunXXXX_metadata_file.csv` (cell metadata file). Let's call them `RAW_TX` and `RAW_META`.

Run the following commands to extract relevant information from the raw csv files:

```bash
# Extract cell coordinates
cut -d',' -f 1,2,3,7,8 ${RAW_META} | tail -n +2 | sed 's/"//g' | \
  awk -F',' -v OFS="\t" -v mu=${MICRONS_PER_PIXEL} \
  '{printf "%.2f\t%.2f\t%s_%s\t%s\n", $4*mu, $5*mu, $1, $2, $3}' > cell_centers.tsv

# Extract transcripts
awk -F',' -v OFS=$'\t' -v mu=${MICRONS_PER_PIXEL} '\
NR==1{gsub(/"/, "", $0); print "#" $3, $4, $8, "count", $7, "CellID", $9 }\
NR>1{gsub(/"/, "", $8); gsub(/"/, "", $9); printf "%.2f\t%.2f\t%s\t%d\t%s\t%s_%s\t%s\n", mu*$3, mu*$4, $8, 1, $7, $1, $2, $9 } ' ${RAW_TX} > transcripts.tsv
```

## MERSCOPE

You can use the template `Makefile` and `config_prepare.json` in `punkst/examples/format_input/merscope` to conver MERSCOPE raw output files to the generic input format.

Set `"rawdir"` to be the path that contains the MERSCOPE output files. We will need the following files: `cell_metadata.csv.gz` and `detected_transcripts.csv.gz`. If your data is compressed, set `"compressed"` to 1, otherwise (plain csv) set it to 0.
Set `"datadir"` to the output directory.

The following are the commands ran in the `Makefile`:

```bash
# Extract cell coordinates
zcat ${RAWDIR}/cell_metadata.csv.gz | cut -d',' -f 4-9 | tail -n +2 | awk -F',' -v OFS="\t" '{ print $1, $2; }' > cell_coordinates.tsv
# Extract transcripts
zcat ${RAWDIR}/detected_transcripts.csv.gz \
  | cut -d',' -f2-5,9 \
  | sed \
      -e '0,/barcode/{s/barcode/#barcode/}' \
      -e 's/,/\t/g' \
      -e 's/$/\t1/' \
      -e '0,/barcode/{s/\t1$/\tcount/}' \
    > transcripts.tsv
```

## Xenium

You can use the template `Makefile` and `config_prepare.json` in `punkst/examples/format_input/xenium` to conver Xenium raw output files to the generic input format.

In the `config.json`, you need specify `"raw_transcripts"` as the path of the transcript file `transcripts.csv.gz` and `"raw_cells"` as the path of the cell metadata `cells.csv.gz`.

The following are the commands ran in the `Makefile`:

```bash
# Extract transcripts
zcat transcripts.csv.gz \
  | cut -d',' -f4-6 | sed 's/"//g' \
  | awk -F',' -v OFS="\t" '{ print $2, $3, $1, "1" }' \
  > transcripts.tsv

# Extract cell coordinates
zcat cells.csv.gz \
  | cut -d',' -f2-3 \
  | tail -n +2 \
  | awk -F',' -v OFS="\t" '{printf "%.4f\t%.4f\n", $1,$2;}' > cell_coordinates.tsv
```

## SpatialData (zarr)

If your data is stored as a [SpatialData](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/) `.zarr` store (e.g. produced by `spatialdata-io` from Xenium, MERSCOPE, CosMx, or Visium HD raw output), use `ext/py/spatialdata_to_punkst.py` to export a `Points` element to the generic transcript TSV format. This requires the `spatialdata` python package.

```bash
python punkst/ext/py/spatialdata_to_punkst.py \
  --sdata /path/to/data.zarr \
  --points-key transcripts \
  --coordinate-system global \
  --out transcripts.tsv
```

Notes:

- `--points-key` is the name of the `Points` element in `sdata.points` (e.g. `"transcripts"`).
- `--coordinate-system` selects which of the element's registered coordinate systems to materialize coordinates in (SpatialData elements can be aligned into more than one). If the element is registered in only one coordinate system, this can be omitted.
- The gene/feature column is inferred from the element's `feature_key` metadata; override with `--feature-column` if needed.
- By default each row is treated as one molecule (no count column); pass `--count-column` if your points table already has a per-row count.
- Output is streamed partition-by-partition from the underlying Dask dataframe, so it does not require materializing the whole points table in memory.

The resulting `transcripts.tsv` has a `#`-prefixed header and can be fed directly into [pts2tiles](../modules/pts2tiles.md) with `--skip 1`.

## 10X Single cell

If you would like to apply topic modeling or matrix factorization to your single cell data, you can convert the 10X Genomics single-cell DGE files to files used by `punkst topic-model` and `nmf-pois-log1p` etc. by the following command:

```bash
punkst convert-10X-SC \
--in-dge-dir /path/to/dge/folder --sorted-by-barcode \
--randomize --sort-mem 1G \
--out /path/to/output/prefix
```
The input folder should contain the standard 10X files: `barcodes.tsv.gz`, `features.tsv.gz`, and `matrix.mtx.gz` (gziped). Alternatively, you can specify the three files directly by `--in-barcodes`, `--in-features`, and `--in-matrix`.
Since normally the matrix is sorted by barcode indices, adding `--sorted-by-barcode` enables streaming mode though this is optional.

The output includes three files: the pair `${out}.tsv`, `${out}.json` (the main count matrix) and `${out}.features.tsv`. Since the gene names are not necessarily unique in the 10X DGE (multiple Ensembl IDs may map to the same gene symbol), the program replace duplicate gene names with the Ensembl IDs while keeping the one with the highest total count as the gene symbol. So the first column in the output feature file contains unique feature names (mostly gene symbols). The second column contains the total counts.

For the downstream topic model to run in minibatch mode efficiently, the flag `--randomize` ensures that the order of cells is randomized in the output. The randomization is done by sorting a random key assigned to each cell. With `--sorted-by-barcode`, the maximum memory usage is usually determined by the buffer size in the sorting (ransomization) step which can be controlled by `--sort-mem`. The recognized memory units are `K`, `M`, and `G`. By default the program uses your system's `sort` (GNU sort), unless you specify `--use-internal-sort`.
